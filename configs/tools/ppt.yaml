  ppt_generation_prompt: |
    You are an expert in PowerPoint generation. 
    Given a url or a document, you are required to:

    1. Analyze the content and structure of the report or document.
    2. Arrange the content in a logical and coherent manner. You should divide the content into slides to meet the requirements of the json schema.
    3. Generate a PowerPoint presentation based on the given json schema and content page by page.

    ## Slide Type Diversity Requirements
    When arranging slides, follow these diversity rules:
    1. Use a variety of slide types throughout the presentation
    2. Avoid using the same slide type for two consecutive slides
    3. Mix different slide types such as: items_page_4, item_page_4_growth, etc.
    4. Ensure the slide types are appropriate for the content being presented
    5. Avoid using too much "content" and "two_column_content" pages, try to use more structured pages such as "item_page_4_growth", "item_page_6_sequence", etc.

    ## Content Length Requirements
    Follow these strict length constraints for different content types:
    1. For titles and subtitles: Keep between 5-15 characters, retain only key information
    2. For bullet points and item lists: Keep between 5-15 characters per item
    3. For detailed content descriptions: Provide details but keep under 50 characters

    Extract only the key points and arrange them in a logical and coherent manner. Avoid diving too deep into details.

    ## Visualization Requirements
    1. If there are any images in the provided information, you are encouraged to use them in the presentation (with its local path and caption).
    2. If no images are provided, you can provide image descriptions instead (in `image_description` field rather than `image_url` field). The subsequent process will generate high-quality images based on your descriptions for use in the PPT.
    3. Genrated images have higher priority than the provided images.
    4. And remember you can insert table into the content page.

    ## Example Arragenment
    1. (title) title: Attention is All You Need
    2. (item_page_5_sequence) introduction of the paper (...)
    3. (section_title) section title: Related Work
    4. (items_page_4) items: [...]
    5. (items_page_4_key_point) conclusion of the paper (...)
    6. (acknowledgement) acknowledgement: [...]

    {schema}

    Now finish your task:
  markdown_outline_translation_prompt: |
    Your task is to translate a markdown-formatted PPT outline into a JSON structure that conforms to the given schema.

    ## Markdown Format Specification
    The markdown outline uses 4 levels of headers, marked by different numbers of "#" symbols:
    - **Level 1 Header (#)**: Represents the title of the cover slide. It means the `title_page` in the json schema
    - **Level 2 Header (##)**: Represents the title of section transition slides between chapters. It means the `section_title_page` in the json schema.
    - **Level 3 Header (###)**: Represents the title of a specific content slide. It's the `title` field in the json schema of the corresponding content page. **IMPORTANT**: All content under each level 3 header MUST BE in a single content page!!!
    - **Level 4 Header (####)**: Represents sub-headings for bullet points within a slide. It's the `title` field of ech items, where the number of `items` is the same as the number of sub-headings.
    - **Content under Level 4 headers**: Bullet points (marked with "-") represent the detailed content under each sub-heading. It's the `content` field of each item.

    ## Translation Requirements
    1. **Preserve All Information**: You MUST NOT change, omit, or add any information from the markdown outline. Translate it completely and accurately into JSON format.
    2. **Maintain Structure**: Keep the hierarchical structure and logical flow of the original outline.
    3. **Follow Schema**: Ensure the output JSON strictly conforms to the provided schema.
    4. **Character Encoding**: Preserve all special characters, punctuation, and formatting marks correctly.

    ## Input Format
    You will receive:
    1. A JSON schema that defines the structure of the output
    2. A markdown outline that needs to be translated

    ## Output Format
    Generate a valid JSON object that:
    - Matches the provided schema structure
    - Contains all information from the markdown outline
    - Maintains the original content without any modifications

    Schema:
    {schema}

    Markdown Outline:
    {outline}

    Now translate the markdown outline into JSON format according to the schema:
